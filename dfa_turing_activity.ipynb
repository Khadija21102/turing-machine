    "### Key DFA Components\n",
    "\n",
    "#### States\n",
    "Each DFA consists of a finite set of states that represent different stages of input processing. In the password verifier, states represent whether a password remains valid or should be rejected based on past input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transitions\n",
    "Defined state changes occur based on input symbols (digits in this case). Example: If the DFA is in a valid state and reads an ‘8’, it transitions to another state. If the next digit is ‘6’, the DFA transitions to a rejection state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accept/Reject Conditions\n",
    "The accept state confirms a valid password. The reject state is triggered by invalid sequences (e.g., ‘86’ in the password rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Language of the DFA\n",
    "The set of inputs that the machine accepts is called the language of the DFA.We then say that the machine M accepts the language A or that M recognizes A. In our password verifier, the language corresponds to all the valid passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example DFA Flow for the Password Verifier:\n",
    "1. The DFA starts in an initial state.\n",
    "2. It transitions through states as the user enters digits.\n",
    "3. If it encounters ‘86’, it moves to a reject state.\n",
    "4. If the password is 8 digits long without breaking the rules, it reaches an accept state.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "dedf2c6a",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### What is the Problem with DFA alone and what is an NFA?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why DFA is Limited?\n",
    "DFA cannot handle certain complex constraints, such as maintaining global conditions (e.g., counting the number of even and odd digits).\n",
    "\n",
    "The NFA challenge in the activity highlights this limitation, as the second problem requires tracking the count of even and odd digits simultaneously, which a DFA cannot do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is NFA?\n",
    "A Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) is a theoretical model of computation that allows for multiple transitions from a single state for the same input symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does NFA solve the problem?\n",
    "It adds a new state transition for each input symbol, allowing the automaton to explore multiple paths simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transition, called epsilon (ε) transition, allows the NFA to accept a wider range of languages than a DFA. This transition means that the NFA can move to a new state without consuming any input symbol, or stay in the same state (hence we have simultaneous paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NFA example flow for the password verifier:\n",
    "1. The NFA starts in an initial state.\n",
    "2. It transitions through states as the user enters digits, exploring multiple paths in parallel.\n",
    "3. If it encounters ‘86’, it moves to a reject state.\n",
    "4. If the password is 8 digits long without breaking the rules, it might reach an accept state in one of the paths.\n",
    "5. If any path leads to an accept state, the NFA accepts the password.\n"
